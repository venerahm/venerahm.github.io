    "text": "This month, Annie Cohen and Hanna Venera join Practical Significance co-hosts Donna LaLonde and Ron Wasserstein to discuss their roles as co-presidents of STATCOM at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. They can’t contain their enthusiasm for this special initiative and the intrinsic reward of working within the community, although they acknowledge the challenges of maintaining momentum as students graduate and leadership changes hands.\nHaving benefited from being part of a dynamic program, Cohen and Venera have a long-term vision to reinvigorate STATCOM programs on campuses nationwide and are highly motivated to spread awareness.
