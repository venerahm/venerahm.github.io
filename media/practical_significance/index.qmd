Statistics in the Community, or STATCOM, is a student-run community outreach program launched at Purdue University in 2006. It offers students a unique opportunity to apply their statistical expertise by providing pro bono consulting services to community organizations.
 
This month, Annie Cohen and Hanna Venera join Practical Significance co-hosts Donna LaLonde and Ron Wasserstein to discuss their roles as co-presidents of STATCOM at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. They can’t contain their enthusiasm for this special initiative and the intrinsic reward of working within the community, although they acknowledge the challenges of maintaining momentum as students graduate and leadership changes hands.
 
Having benefited from being part of a dynamic program, Cohen and Venera have a long-term vision to reinvigorate STATCOM programs on campuses nationwide and are highly motivated to spread awareness. The duo is planning a “STATCOM 101” webinar on September 27 at 4:00 p.m. ET. This will be an opportunity for students and faculty interested in getting a program rolling or members of existing programs who want a refresher. Sign up and stand by for a calendar invitation. If you have questions about STATCOM, email statcom-um@umich.edu.
